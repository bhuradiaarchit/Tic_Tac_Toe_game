# TicTacToeGame
 The Java Tic Tac Toe game is a console-based two-player experience on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking spaces until one wins or the board is full, resulting in a draw. The program validates moves, displays the board, and checks for a win or draw, employing a modular structure for code simplicity.
